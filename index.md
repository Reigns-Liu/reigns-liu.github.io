### <i class="fa-regular fa-user"></i> Bio

I'm an IT Support Engineer based in Phoenix, Arizona. I currently support enterprise systems at <a href="https://www.tsmc.com/english">TSMC</a> and enjoy building tools and applications that make technical workflows faster and more intuitive.

I earned my B.E. in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.byui.edu/">Brigham Young University–Idaho</a>, where I worked on projects in web development, data visualization, and machine learning. Those experiences taught me how to combine problem-solving with design and usability.

I'm passionate about exploring new technologies, improving user experiences, and creating software that helps people work smarter and more efficiently.
